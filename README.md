A passion project - One of my family member is tour guide for western european countries so I know how valuable travel expert opinion can be when planning a trip. But not everyone wants a tour guide on their trip, so why not build an easily accessible AI agent but with the same knowledge and capabilities?

This is an multi-agent AI-powered travel planning website designed to assist 1) provide insights on dream destinations 2) plan your travel itinerary based on your unique preferences.

I used a Groq Model ("llama-3.3-70b-versatile") here because of its small size and relatively fast response time.
